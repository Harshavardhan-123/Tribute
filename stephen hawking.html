          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née Walker).Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.
            
            His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home. Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.
            
            Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).

            In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire. In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.
            
            During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.
